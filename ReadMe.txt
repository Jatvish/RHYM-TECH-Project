Overview of the Project:

The "RHYM TECHNOLOGIES Project" is designed as a centralized hub for cybersecurity information. It aggregates and presents essential data about threats, techniques, and solutions in an intuitive web interface. Through this platform, users can access up-to-date information on cyber threats, learn about various attack techniques, and explore recommended cybersecurity practices.

2. run the app.py file on terminal
3. open the index.html file
